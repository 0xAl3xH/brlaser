"brlaser" Brother DCP-7030 printer driver
=========================================

This is a driver for the Brother DCP-7030 laser printer. It might also
be worth trying if you have some other old Brother monochrome laser
printer.

Currently this printer is not supported by other free software
drivers. Ghostscript's hl1250 driver almost works, but has glitches
with some fonts. (That driver tries to use PCL emulation, but that
seems to be buggy on this printer. The proprietary driver never uses
that mode.)

Brother provides a non-free x86-only driver.

Requirements
------------

* CUPS: tested with version 1.6.
* A C++11 compiler: GCC 4.6 or later, or a recent version of Clang.
